2,NA,NA,29,Female,Never learned,"I gave each character a name - two glasses, a house, letters E or CC, etc. I was saying them out loud when they appeared on screen, but sometimes I would confuse myself by it. If the previous board was ""house, glasses, CC"", it was stuck in my head even when the next board appeared. It was more difficult to ""name"" the newly introduced characters so I just tried to remember their shapes and how complicated they were. For example, ""this shape includes S and E, but it was more complicated than the other one, so I will choose the more compplicated one"".",No,"It was really interesting, thank you for allowing me to participate."
